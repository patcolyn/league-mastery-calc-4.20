League of Legends: 4.20 Mastery Calculator
===========================================

This project was designed to experiment with the new mastery changes that came
with season 2 and has now been updated for patch 4.20. It features a very fast
interface with fully functional talent trees that work as you would expect in
game. Each point you change will automatically alter the URL to provide a unique
link so that you may share a build with other players. The calculator does not
rely on any server technology, and thus may be saved and used offline if
desired.
